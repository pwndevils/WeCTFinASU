# Reimbursable

## Transportation

Before you book your flight, economy seating only. Send Zachary Wimer the proposed flight info for approval. Seat upgrades will not be reimbursed. If you would like to use another method of transportation please submit the information about it first!

## Airport Transportation

Transportation to and from the airports will be covered. `Uber` and `Lyft` are very easy to reimburse. Taxi's are reimbursable as well *as long as you keep the reciept*. To keep costs down we ask team members on the same flight to car-pool. If you would prefer to take a bus, scooter, or any other method of transportation it must either be cheaper than the taxi-alternative or Zachary Wimer must have approved it first.

Upon arrival to PHX airport: If you arrive between the hours of 5:30 am and 10:00 pm please call the Mariott's free hotel shuttle at [480-966-2800](tel://1-480-966-2800). This same shuttle will transport you from the hotel to the airport on your return trip. If you arrive outside of these hours you may utilize any of the options listed above.

## Per Diem

Each team member will be given a maximum per diem of $46 per day broken down as $10 for breakfast, $12 for lunch, and $24 for dinner; that is to say if you leave for the airport from your house at 6:00 pm your per-diem for the day will be $24. Similarly if you arrive back home at 8:00 am your per-diem will be only $10.

If a member of ASU funds one of your meals you may not claim your per-diem for that meal. For example, if one day at ASU you pay for your own breakfast and lunch but you go to a group-dinner funded by an ASU representative you may only claim $10 + $12 for your per-diem.

You do not need to keep any receipts for food. Your per-diem will be granted in full even if you spend less than it. That is if you spend $5 for breakfast you will still receive a $10 reimbursement for breakfast.

## Other expenses

These require pre-approval from Zachary Wimer.

# Reimbursements

## Receipts

Please keep *all* receipts for everything you would like reimbursed (receipts are needed, not just things that state the total costs but things that state how much you payed). Meal receipts are the one exception to this as your per-diem is independent of the money you spend on your meals.

## Process

During the second day of the workshop, Zachary Wimer will walk everyone through the reimbursement request to make it as painless as possible.
